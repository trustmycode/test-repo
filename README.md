21 Types of "Fascination Bullets" (by Clayton Makepeace) | PART I

**This is “PART I” of a 4-part series – here's a brief introduction:**

>The ability to write great bullets and fascinations is one of the most powerful skills you'll EVER acquire as a copywriter. And the ability to \*recognize\* both good and bad ones is essential to being a great direct response entrepreneur or marketing director.

&#x200B;

* Powerfully stimulate curiosity and intrigue...
* Seduce your prospect to read, read, READ!
* Build desire – little by little – by creating the urge to "know" the secret your bullet promises to reveal...Seize your prospect's attention and keep him zooming through the copy...
* Make your sales message more readable (which \*always\*) boosts response!)...
* Pump up your promotions with more variety and prevent the disastrous "flat" benefit syndrome...
* Crush "headline block," instantly delivering a wealth of fantastic headline possibilities...

&#x200B;

**#1. The "How To" Bullet**

>This is probably the single most popular type of bullet/fascination and you see loads of it, both online and off. It works because we seem to have a natural affinity and curiosity for "how to" information. That's especially true if the "how to" information is tied into your deepest feelings and desires. That's the key to making it work.

&#x200B;

* *"How to use the secrets of "loading" your body for maximum power! (Traditional swings rob you of this potential power – while the Triple Coil Swing actually increases it two-fold!)"*
* *"How to make yourself safer than 89% of other car passengers – page 389."*
* *"How to rub your stomach away. The simplest and most natural way to lose weight is by this effortless two-minute exercise.*

&#x200B;

**#2. The "Secret To" Bullet**

>This formula is perfect when you have a piece of information not commonly known – something that can be legitimately called a "secret". Typically the "secret" is centered on "how" your prospect will get the benefit. Be careful not to overuse this idea, however, or your prospect will become excessively skeptical.  
>  
>\-  
>  
>After all, if everything is a secret then each one becomes a little less unique and enticing. These bullets MUST be based on information not commonly known and varied for maximum impact.

&#x200B;

* *"The secrets of 'Single Finger' takedowns... using moves that are indefensible even by a larger and more experienced opponent!"*
* *"Little known secrets that can steer you to tremendous profits in gold... even if bullion drops to $250 an ounce!”*
* *"The secret of 'that schoolgirl complexion' revealed! This is the natural compound you must have for health, beauty and long life. Develops that youthful beauty from within.”*

&#x200B;

**#3. The "Why" Bullet**

>This bullet is ideal for building intrigue. Essentially, you're promising to reveal why something is a certain way – with the implication that knowing why will make a difference in your prospect's life.  
>  
>\-  
>  
>So make extra sure the info your promise presents is... (a) something your prospect is instantly curious to know more about and (b) directly beneficial in his life.

&#x200B;

* *"Why if this disaster strikes the US, you'll pay up to 15 times more money for cheap imitations of your favorite supplements – and why that's the good news!"*\-
* *"Why up to 70 percent of all poisonings happen to children under five. And the best prevention of them all. Page 34."*
* *"Why you can't trust your pension fund: Dirty tricks they play with your money – and how to stop them COLD..."*

&#x200B;

**#4. The “What” Bullet**

>“What” bullets work well in two ways. First they can give your prospect very specific instructions for action (“What you MUST do now to avoid…”).  
>  
>\-  
>  
>Second, they often offer him elusive, valuable information (“What doctors don’t tell you about…”). Both do a wonderful job of bumping up the perceived value of the information, while at the same time hiding it for added curiosity!

&#x200B;

* *What you must do immediately before November 15th, 2001 to preserve your wealth and…”*
* *“What you must do at once if you receive a mild shock when you touch an electric appliance – page 26.”*
* *“What the Corporate Fat Cats don’t tell you about their CoQ10 supplements…”*
* *“What to watch when you’re eight feet apart (it’s NOT his eyes – a terrible mistake most fighters make that gets them hurt)... and what to watch inside the two feet “crunch time zone”... to keep you a precious step ahead of even superbly-trained fighters!”*

&#x200B;

**#5. The “What NEVER” Bullet**

>If you’ve ever read a Boardroom report, I’d bet big money you’ve seen this type of bullet. They popularized it with the following bullet that became a blockbuster headline:

&#x200B;

* *“What never to eat on an airplane. The dirtiest, deadliest airplane in the whole wide world.”*

&#x200B;

>Here’s another example:

&#x200B;

* *"What never to keep in your deposit box. Never. And how to stop the state from stealing it.”*

&#x200B;

>This kind of bullet/fascination can be applied to many, many pieces of information. And it’s powerful because it alerts him of a possible mistake (tapping into fear emotion), promises information that will protect your prospect from the mistake (benefit), and also builds curiosity and intrigue because he doesn’t yet know the answer.  
>  
>\-  
>  
>If you’re selling supplements, you could say, **“What NEVER to take along with Vitamin C…”** If you’re in the investment market, you could say, **“What NEVER to invest in as inflation rises…”** This list could go on for miles.  
>  
>\-  
>  
>Along the same lines, you can present any other type of “What NEVER” information with leads like “Why you should not…” or “The absolute worst…” or “What to avoid…” – because the premise is exactly the same. Just play around with the different versions and see which works best for your information. Here are a few more examples:

&#x200B;

* *“Why you should* *not* *use soap anywhere but under the arms and on the genitals. Page 37.”*
* *“The absolute* *worst* *time for your body to do paperwork or read. Page 26.”*
* *“The One Place NEVER to Store Your Gold: It’s practically an engraved invitation to thieves. Where to store your gold for maximum safety and convenience.*
